Basic principle of the differential QSM approach:

1) Have data with region of interest \Omega and also a background (not of interest)
2) Want to effectively separate the data of interest from the boring background

Procedure:
    a) acquitre MR data
            i) at multiple echo times
            ii) at a single echo time

    b) get relationship between B-field and magnetic susceptibility (both at same location)
            i) use Laplacian of B-field and 1/3 of Lap. of \chi minus second derivative of \chi

    c) convolute b) to get the noise property
            i) colvolving b) with a Green's function
            ii) colvolving b) with 1/r where r is the distance to some origin in 3D space

    d) estimate \chi distribution based on the noise property
