Basic principle of the differential QSM approach:

1) Have data with region of interest \Omega and also a background (not of interest)
2) Want to effectively separate the data of interest from the boring background

Procedure:
    a) acquitre MR data
            i) at multiple echo times
            ii) at a single echo time
    b)
