patent: http://www.patentsencyclopedia.com/app/20150145515

1) Have data with region of interest \Omega and also a background (not of interest)
2) Want to effectively separate the data of interest from the boring background

Procedure:
    a) acquire MR data
            i) at multiple echo times
            ii) at a single echo time

    b) get relationship between B-field and magnetic susceptibility (both at same location)
            i) use Laplacian of B-field and 1/3 of Lap. of \chi minus second derivative of \chi
            -> magnetic field:
                    -> local magnetic field distribution superimposed on a
                    -> background magnetic field distribution
                            -> local magnetic field distribution corresponds to
                                magnetic susceptibility distribution of subject

    c) convolute b) to get the noise property (corresponds to noise in B-field)
            i) colvolving b) with a Green's function
            ii) colvolving b) with 1/r where r is the distance to some origin in 3D space

    d) estimate \chi distribution based on the noise property
            i) determining a cost function
                -> corresponds to a susceptibility distribution,
                   magnetic field,
                   mask corresponding to a region of interest
                   a Green's function
                    -> cost function: convolution of a Green's function, mask and Laplacian of B-field
                    -> cost function: convolution of a Green's function, mask and partial diff. of \chi

            ii) determining a susceptibility distribution that minimizes the cost function
                as estimated suscc. distrib. of the subject
                    -> performing a least squares fitting based on noise property

    e) further regularizing the estimated susceptibility distribution based on prior information       regarding the subject
        -> determining boundary conditions associated with the subject

    f) system for mapping tissue magnetic \chi:
        -> processing module
            -> operable to: acquire magnetic resonance (MR) data,
               determine a magnetic field based on this data,
               determine b), c), d), ....

    g) generating one or more images based on this
